# 365 Days Of Machine Learning and Deep Learning ⚒
⌚ Here I will be documenting my journey from ▶14 June 2021 to 14 June 2022🔚 

### Day 01 : 
***Torchtext Library from Pytorch*** 

Started working on an NLP project (Depression-Detection) implementing advanced NLP practices and got suggested the torchtext library from pytorch. 
The library provides a set of classes that are useful in NLP tasks. Bascially this library takes care of the typical components of NLP tasks namely : 

1. Preprocessing and Tokenization
2. Generating vocabulary of unique toke and converting words to indices
3. Loading Pretrained vectors like Glove, Word2vec,etc 
4. Padding text with zeroes in case of variable lengths
5. Dataloading and batching

So basically the preprocessing stages of NLP with minimal code. Looking into these points in detail and applying them into the preprocessing phases of the project tomorrow.

On the process of learning about torchtext i revised on Padding and came across word vector libraries like glove and fasttext. 
#### Padding in NLP
Why do we use padding in NLP tasks? → Padded sequences basically convert our tokenized lists of words into the same length. Example : 

```python
padded = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen = 5)
print('\nPadded Sequences = {}'.format(padded)) 
```
The above snippet of code converts our tokenized sentences into the maximum length of 5 words.
Meaning a 7 word sentence will be padded into a 5 word sentence.  Similarly if the max padding length in 10 and our sentence has 5 words than our remaining places will be replaced be padded with 0.
#### Word Vectors
Word vectors or embeddings is a methodology in NLP to map words or phrases from vocabulary to a corresponding vector of real numbers where each number represents a word from the phrase.
What i learnt is that torchtext makes implementing pretrained word vectors much easier by just mentioning the name of one or specify the path of a word vector that we will be using and is predownloaded.
